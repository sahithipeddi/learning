    /* We will learn more concepts about inheritance, data binding and polymorphism
    *
    *  Object means real world entity such as a chair or a table. It is designed to design a program using classes and objects.
    *  It simplifies the software development and maintenance by providing some concepts.
    *
    *  1) Object 2) Class 3) Inheritance 4) Polymorphism 5) Abstraction 6) Encapsulation
    *
    * 1) Object: An entity that has a state/behaviour is known as object. An object contains address and can hold the memory.
     *       Objects can communicate with each other with out knowing the details of each other's data. The only necessary things is
     *       1)Type of message accepted and 2) Type of message returned
     *
    * 2) Class: Collection of objects is called a class. It's a logical entity.
     *      Classes doesn't hold any memory and is considered as a bluePrint from which you can create individual object.
     *
    * 3) Inheritance: When an Object acquires all the properties and behaviours of a parent object, It is called as Inheritance. It provides code reusability.
    *       It is used for runtime Polymorphism
    *
    * 4) Polymorphism: To perform a action in a different format is called as polymorphism.
    *       To convince a customer to draw a Triangle, Square, Rectangle etc. This can be achieved by method overloading or method overwriting.
    *
    * 5) Abstraction: Hiding internal details and showing the functionality is called as abstraction. For e.g. Making a phone call, We do not know internal
    *       details while making one. In Java, we use interface and abstract class to achieve abstraction.
    *
    * 6) Encapsulation: Binding of code and data together into a single unit is called as encapsulation. Java bean is a example of encapsulation.
    *       Java bean is a fully encapsulated class because all the data members are private.
